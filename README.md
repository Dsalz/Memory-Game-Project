## About
 This is a fun memory game coded by me as part of the projects in the front-end nanodegree program at udacity. Hope you enjoy!
 
## How to Play
- http://dsalz.github.io/Memory-Game-Project/ is where the game is hosted
- Click on tiles to turn them over and reveal the icons underneath
- The goal of the game is to match two cards with the same icon
- Try to match them all in as little moves as possible to get 3 stars 
- But above all HAVE FUN!
